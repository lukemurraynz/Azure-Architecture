# Solution Requirements Questionnaire

These questions are intended to capture Information and business requirements to
ensure that the solution is designed and priced appropriately according to
relevant criticality, security and risk.

These questions help to develop a solution that allows us to:

-   Reduce Waste

-   Mitigate Risk

-   Improve Security

-   Embrace what's next

Some of the questions you may not be able to answer. However, they should be
remembered when thinking of the solution and business requirements.

The answer to these questions will affect the IT architecture of the solution,
both the components used and the cost of the service.

1.  If the system becomes unavailable for any reason, what is the pain level if
