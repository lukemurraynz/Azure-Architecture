## Non-Functional Requirements to think of when designing/implementing Cloud based services:

The definition of a non-functional requirement is:
Any requirement which specifies how the system performs a certain function.
In other words, a non-functional requirement will describe how a system should behave and what limits there are on its functionality. 
Non-functional requirements generally specify the system’s quality attributes or characteristics, for example: “Modified data in a database should be updated for all users accessing it within 2 seconds.”
