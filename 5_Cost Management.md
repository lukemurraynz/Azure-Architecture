## Cost Management

### Budgets

Implement Budget alerts. These Alerts will be configured to email the Business
Owners or other Stakeholders once a Resource Group reaches a specific threshold.

It is recommended to set 3 Budget alerts, to help with awareness.

For Resource Group budgets the following naming standard has been created for
Resource Groups:

| Budget Name                                 | Alert Threshold (Percent) |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| {RESOURCEGROUPNAME}-MonthlyBudget-{Number}  | 50%                       |
| {RESOURCEGROUPNAME}-MonthlyBudget-{Number}  | 60%                       |
| {RESOURCEGROUPNAME}-MonthlyBudget-{Number}  | 70%                       |

For Subscription budgets the following naming standard is created:

| Budget Name                                | Alert Threshold (Percent) |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| {SUBSCRIPTIONNAME}-MonthlyBudget-{Number}  | 50%                       |
| {SUBSCRIPTIONNAME}-MonthlyBudget-{Number}  | 60%                       |
| {SUBSCRIPTIONNAME}-MonthlyBudget-{Number}  | 70%                       |
